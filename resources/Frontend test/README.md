# The HTML/CSS test

We would like to ask you to build a webpage using HTML and CSS. No javascript.

Take a look at the image supplied "Dev-design task". It's supplied in PNG as well as photoshop 
format. If you do not have access to photoshop, please use the PNG image.

The basic assets are supplied as well. 

We ask you to build a webpage that is similar to the supplied image, using only HTML, CSS and the supplied assets.

The ideal solution will be standards compliant and render correctly in all major browsers (IE11, Firefox, Safari and Chrome). It will look exactly as the image on a sufficiently large browser.

If you feel up to the task, we would also welcome a solution that's responsive and reflows all
elements according to the size of the browser down to smartphone size.
